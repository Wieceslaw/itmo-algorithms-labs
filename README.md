# itmo-algorithms-labs
First semester itmo laboratory tasks 

There are:
- different sorting algorithms: insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, randomized quick sort, randomized quick sort with 3 partition, radix sort
- different data structures implementations: stack, linked list, double linked list, queue, priority queue, set, hash tables, chain set
- other: linear search, subarray search, antiquick sort algorithm which generates the slowest sequence for quick sort
- dynamic programming tasks: simple regex
